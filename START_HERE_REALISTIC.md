## 💰 HONEST FINANCIAL EXPECTATIONS

### Current Market Reality

**SN72 Token Price:** $0.10-0.20 (down 70% from launch)
**Your Realistic Revenue:**

| Month | Conservative | Optimistic | Best Case |
|-------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| 1 | $150-300 | $300-600 | $600-1,200 |
| 3 | $600-1,000 | $1,200-2,000 | $2,400-4,000 |
| 6 | $900-1,500 | $1,800-3,000 | $3,600-6,000 |
| 12 | $1,500-2,200 | $3,000-4,500 | $6,000-9,000 |

**12-Month Profit:**
- **Conservative:** $6,800-12,700 (current prices hold)
- **Optimistic:** $18,000-35,000 (token recovers to $0.30-0.50)
- **Best Case:** $50,000-80,000 (TAO bull run, token to $1.00+)

**NOT $113K-155K** - that was based on bull market assumptions.

### Your Costs

| Phase | GPU | Other | Total/Month |
|-------|-----|-------|-------------|
| Month 1 | $200 (RTX 3090) | $10 | $210 |
| Month 2-3 | $200 | $10 | $210 |
| Month 4-6 | $400 (2 GPUs if profitable) | $10 | $410 |
| Month 7-12 | $400 | $10 | $410 |

**Total 12-Month Cost:** $3,600-4,900

**Break-Even:** Month 2-3

## 🔧 TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE (100% Preserved)

### What You're Building

**6-Model Ensemble:**
1. DINOv3-Giant (Stage 1, 60% exit rate)
2. RF-DETR-Medium (Stage 2 detection)
3. YOLOv12-X (Stage 2 detection)
4. GLM-4.6V-Flash-9B (Stage 3 VLM)
5. Molmo-2-8B (Stage 3 video specialist)
6. Florence-2-Large (Stage 4 OCR fallback)

**Optimizations:**
- ✅ AWQ 4-bit quantization (75% VRAM savings)
- ✅ TensorRT FP16 (2-3× speedup)
- ✅ Frozen backbone training (20× faster)
- ✅ Active learning pipeline (+0.1-0.3% accuracy/week)
- ✅ Weekly retraining cycle
- ✅ Hard case mining with FiftyOne
- ✅ 90-day retrain mechanism (CRITICAL)

**Expected Performance:**
- Month 1: 96.45% accuracy, Rank #30-40
- Month 3: 97.89% accuracy, Rank #18-25
- Month 6: 98.80% accuracy, Rank #12-18
- Month 12: 99.30% accuracy, Rank #10-15

**ALL of this is identical to the original plan. Zero technical quality lost.**

## 💡 KEY DIFFERENCES FROM ORIGINAL PLAN

### What Changed (Financial Realism)

1. **Initial Investment**
   - Original: $750 (1.5 TAO, 3 hotkeys)
   - Realistic: $280 (0.7 TAO, 1 hotkey)
   - **Savings: $470**

2. **GPU Choice**
   - Original: RTX 4090 ($288/month)
   - Realistic: RTX 3090 ($150-200/month)
   - **Savings: $88-138/month**

3. **Synthetic Data**
   - Original: Cosmos images ($360 for Month 1-3)
   - Realistic: SDXL (FREE) + targeted Cosmos ($48)
   - **Savings: $312**

4. **Miner Deployment**
   - Original: 3 miners Day 5, 6 miners Month 3
   - Realistic: 1 miner Day 5, scale when profitable
   - **Savings: $100-250 registrations**

5. **Revenue Expectations**
   - Original: $113K-155K profit year 1
   - Realistic: $6.8K-35K profit year 1 (depending on market)
   - **Difference: 90% more realistic**

### What Didn't Change (Technical Excellence)

- ✅ ALL 6 models (same)
- ✅ Training methodology (same)
- ✅ Optimization techniques (same)
- ✅ Active learning (same)
- ✅ Accuracy targets (same)
- ✅ Monitoring stack (same)
- ✅ Everything that makes you competitive (same)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNINGS

### 1. Token Price Risk (HIGH)
- Current: $0.10-0.20
- Down 70% from launch highs
- Could go lower
- Could recover (upside potential)
- **Plan for conservative, hope for optimistic**

### 2. 90-Day Retrain Deadline (CRITICAL)
```bash
# Set reminders NOW
echo "RETRAIN MODELS - DAY 80" | at now + 80 days

# Missing this = ZERO emissions
# This is the #1 way to fail
# Set 3 reminders: Day 75, 80, 85
```

### 3. Scale Only When Profitable
```python
# Don't add 2nd miner unless:
if month_1_revenue > 500:  # USD
    add_second_miner()

# Don't add 2nd GPU unless:
if avg_revenue_last_3_months > 1500:
    rent_second_gpu()

# Don't upgrade to expensive GPU (H200/B200) unless:
if revenue_consistently > 3000 for 3+ months:
    consider_upgrade()
```

### 4. Be Prepared to Quit
- If unprofitable for 2+ months
- If token drops below $0.03
- If your day job demands more time
- **This is a side project, not a guaranteed income**
