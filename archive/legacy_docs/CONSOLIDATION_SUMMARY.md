7. **most1.md** (3,984 lines) 📋
   - Complete Docker/CI-CD professional toolkit
   - Would add ~1,000 lines of technical infrastructure details
   - DECISION: SKIP - Would make file too technical/overwhelming

8. **most2.md** (2,042 lines) 📋
   - Realistic scaling from $150/month
   - DECISION: SKIP - Already covered in ff15.md comprehensive roadmap

9. **most3.md** (1,185 lines) 📋
   - Modular MAX is FREE clarification
   - Technology index
   - DECISION: PARTIAL - Key insights already captured

10. **most4.md** (1,390 lines) 📋
   - Ultimate master index of tools
   - DECISION: SKIP - Reference material, not actionable
