  To make REALISTIC_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md “best‑case and complete,” add:                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  1. A short **“Tool Policies”** section that, for each item in your table, spells out:                                                                                                 
  - When it is enabled (by month and by revenue)                                                                                                                                        
  - On which hardware (3090 vs 4090 vs H100)                                                                                                                                            
  - Any usage caps (Marengo, Molmo, Omni)[16][20][1]                                                                                                                                    
  2. A **precision table** for TensorRT/AutoAWQ so models have fixed FP16/FP8/INT4 settings.[11][10][2]                                                                                 
  3. One **Mojo/MAX kernel commitment** (DINOv3 pre‑proc using 2D map pattern).[5][2]                                                                                                   
  4. Version pins and upgrade criteria for **FiftyOne + Enterprise** and a note about supported Python/Mongo.[18][19][17][2]                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Once those are written in, your table of 12 “missing” items is fully resolved and the plan becomes a **coherent, best‑case December 20, 2025 stack**, not just a list of tools.

  [39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7bIdv2FQzY)  The remaining gaps now are not more named tools, but **how you use them together at “best‑case” level**: Omni/Modular/Mojo,        
  TensorRT/quant, and data tools all need one more layer of detail.

  Your plan lists Modular MAX and links Mojo GPU puzzles, but it never states **a concrete use** of Mojo kernels in the StreetVision miner.[1][2][3][4]                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Missing points:                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - A specific kernel target:                                                                                                                                                           
  - Use a Mojo 2D **map** kernel (like Puzzle 04) for image pre‑processing: resize, normalization, simple augmentations, or per‑pixel masks before DINOv3.[1]                           
  - This fits exactly the 2D‑thread indexing + bounds‑check pattern from the tutorial.[1]                                                                                               
  - Integration decision:                                                                                                                                                               
  - Clarify that **Stage 1 DINOv3 pre‑proc** can be moved from PyTorch CPU to a Mojo GPU kernel to cut a few ms per image.[3][1]                                                        
  - State that you only do this **after** basic cascade is stable (Month 2+), so you do not block MVP.[5]                                                                               
  - Hardware portability:                                                                                                                                                               
  - If you ever move to AMD or Apple GPUs, MAX Engine lets the same Mojo kernels run cross‑vendor.[2][6]                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Right now the documents mention Mojo/MAX but never promise a **single concrete kernel**; adding that makes the story complete.[3][5][1]

  You mention TensorRT and AutoAWQ, but there is no **single canonical recipe** for precisions per model in the realistic plan.[7][8][5][3]

  You already list vLLM‑Omni, Molmo‑2, and TwelveLabs Marengo 3.0, but you still lack **hard usage policies** so “best‑case” does not become “blow up the bill.”[9][10][11][3][5]

  - Months 1–2: **image‑only**; omnivideo stack fully disabled.[5]                                                                                                                      
  - Month 3+ (only if profitable): enable a tiny “video path” using Marengo 3.0 + Molmo‑2‑8B for at most, e.g., 5 % of queries.[12][9][3]                                               
  - Hard numeric caps:                                                                                                                                                                  
  - Marengo: max 300 minutes/month (≈12 USD) until miner >1 500 USD/month.[13][12][5]                                                                                                   
  - Molmo: QPS cap (e.g. 0.1–0.2 requests/s) so it cannot starve the GPU.[14][15][3]

  ## FiftyOne “best‑case” settings                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  You use FiftyOne conceptually, but for a best‑case plan you can still add **two small but important details**.[16][17][3]

  - Pin open‑source to a current release (e.g. `fiftyone==0.22.x`, released Dec 2025) for better performance and newer Mongo support, instead of older 1.11 examples.[17][16]           
  - MongoDB compatibility:                                                                                                                                                              
  - Note the deprecation warning: new FiftyOne releases may drop support for older MongoDB (≤6.0), so best case is to run a supported Mongo version from day one.[18]                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  That makes the data/active‑learning stack future‑proof instead of “it might break later.”[16][18]

  Putting all research together, what is still missing in the best stack:                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  1. **One explicit Mojo/MAX kernel target** (2D map pre‑proc for DINOv3) and when you add it.[3][1]                                                                                    
  2. **A precision table** (FP16/FP8/INT4) per model with AutoAWQ/TensorRT roles, not just names.[7][8][3]                                                                              
  3. **Strict policies and caps** for Omni + Molmo + Marengo usage tied to revenue thresholds.[10][11][9][5]                                                                            
  4. **FiftyOne version + Mongo requirement** for the latest 2025 releases instead of just “FiftyOne.”[18][17][16]                                                                      
  5. A short note that **Month‑1 MVP = no NGINX/Redis/SGLang/Omni/Marengo**, just a single 3090 cascade, and those extras only appear once you hit clear profitability                  
  triggers.[4][5]                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Once you add those five items explicitly into REALISTIC_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md, your plan is aligned with **the latest December 20, 2025 ecosystem** and uses Modular/MAX, Mojo,          
  TensorRT, AutoAWQ, FiftyOne, TwelveLabs, vLLM‑Omni, and Molmo‑2 in a controlled, best‑case way.[15][11][12][7][1][3][5]

  ***                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## 1. Backbone choice (Yann LeCun + JEPA ideas)                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  LeCun’s core points that matter for you: world models should predict in **abstract representation space**, not pixels, and LLMs alone are bad at continuous noisy data like           
  video.[1][2]                                                                                                                                                                          
  Your current choice of DINO‑style image backbone + separate video/VLM model already follows this principle: you learn dense visual features first, then reason on top with a          
  smaller language head.[3][1]                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Best action:                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Keep DINOv3 (or similar strong vision encoder) as the **main 2D backbone**; do not replace it with a pure LLM‑only stack.[1][3]                                                     
  - When you add video, use Molmo 2 as a **video world‑model head** (tracking, counting, temporal reasoning) on top of visual features, not raw pixels or pure text.[2][4]              
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ***                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## 2. SAM 3 for data + exhaustivity (no RL)                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  From the SAM 3 talk and Roboflow docs: SAM 3 adds **concept prompts**, presence tokens, and a data engine that already produced 100M+ smart polygons and ~130 years of label time     
  saved.[5][3]                                                                                                                                                                          
  It segments images and videos with text prompts like “orange traffic cone” or “excavator” and can be fine‑tuned or used just to label data for a smaller RF‑DETR/YOLO‑type            
  model.[6][5]                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Best way for you to use SAM 3 (no RL):                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Month 2+: use SAM 3 only for **hard‑case annotation and coverage checks**, not online inference.[5][1]                                                                              
  - For each validator hard case:                                                                                                                                                       
  - Run SAM 3 with prompts: “roadwork sign”, “orange cone”, “construction barrier”, “worker in vest”, “construction vehicle”.[6][5]                                                     
  - Let the SAM 3 + Roboflow verifier pipeline filter masks; you just correct the few misses.[5]                                                                                        
  - Use SAM 3 masks to:                                                                                                                                                                 
  - Train / refine your RF‑DETR or YOLO detector.[5]                                                                                                                                    
  - Compute “did we find all objects?” checks to catch under‑detections in your cascade.[3]                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  This matches LeCun’s view: use strong vision models and self‑supervised representations, not human‑in‑the‑loop RL, and you get more robust perception with less manual                
  work.[1][3]                                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ***                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## 3. Molmo 2 + vLLM video + Modular tiny GPU                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Molmo 2 is now the **best open video intelligence model**: it tracks multiple objects, counts events, grounds in pixels and timestamps, and beats proprietary models like Gemini      
  3 on video tracking.[7][4][2]                                                                                                                                                         
  vLLM already supports video input as sequences of frames via its multimodal API, and has docs for the `video` field and multi‑GPU inference.[8][9][10]                                
  Modular MAX (and Mojo kernels) give you a portable, small‑GPU story for pre‑ and post‑processing without depending only on CUDA.[11][12]                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Best integration:                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Short clips (≤5–10 s) from images or validator UI:                                                                                                                                  
  - Use Molmo 2‑8B via vLLM multimodal video API on your 3090/4090 for:

  they connect tightly to each other and to OpenDriveLab’s broader research agenda.[1][2]                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## Kun Zhan: world model & closed-loop                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Presents a **world model–based L4 stack** that moves from a “data closed loop” (collect, label, retrain, redeploy) to a **“training closed loop”** where the on‑device driving      
  policy is trained via reinforcement learning inside a high‑fidelity world model.[3][4]                                                                                                
  - The world model combines:                                                                                                                                                           
  - **Regional‑scale 3DGS reconstruction** of real driving scenes,                                                                                                                      
  - **Generative components** (e.g., DrivingSphere, Omni, RLGF) to create rare/long‑tail conditions, and                                                                                
  - A **simulation + RL engine** with smart multi‑agent traffic, reward models (RHF/RxVR/RLF), and goal‑driven training objectives (safety, comfort, efficiency).[4][3]                 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## Why this matters for VLAs                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - The world model is the **training environment**: it produces long‑horizon, diverse trajectories that a driving policy or a VLA can learn from, beyond what sparse real data can     
  cover (e.g., officer gestures, fireworks, ships crossing, adverse weather).[3][4]                                                                                                     
  - Synthetic data from the world model is explicitly used to **balance the dataset** (e.g., weather, rare events), which is key for generalization of any sensor‑to‑action model,      
  including VLAs.[4][3]                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## Ankit Goyal: keep VLAs simple                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Ankit’s VLA‑0 work shows that **state‑of‑the‑art VLAs can be built by treating actions as text tokens on top of an off‑the‑shelf VLM**, with *no architectural modifications*       
  to the base model.[5]                                                                                                                                                                 
  - The talk argues for **simplicity over bespoke architectures**:                                                                                                                      
  - Use a strong VLM backbone,                                                                                                                                                          
  - Represent actions in language space,                                                                                                                                                
  - Rely on data, prompting, and training strategy instead of custom action heads or complex model surgery.[5]                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## How they fit together                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Kun Zhan’s world model + training closed loop gives you a **powerful data and environment engine** (reconstruction, generative simulation, smart agents, RL rewards).[3][4]         
  - Ankit Goyal’s VLA‑0 gives you a **minimalistic action model** that can sit on top: you can let a simple text‑action VLA learn inside that world model instead of designing a        
  complex bespoke control network.[5]                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  If you say what you want from these videos (high‑level summary, design patterns, or concrete implementation steps), a more targeted 1–2 page synthesis can be built around that.

  [27](https://iccv.thecvf.com/virtual/2025/workshop/2745) You already have a very complete plan in the latest `REALISTIC_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md`; what is missing now are **only a few     
  glue pieces** so that nothing from the last 10–20 messages is lost.[file: e861c690-f80d-44bc-9bd8-85bf0f2945c6]                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Below is exactly what to **add/merge** into that plan.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ***                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## 1. Add a “World‑Model & Closed‑Loop” section                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Add a new top‑level section after synthetic data:                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Explain Kun Zhan’s **training closed loop**:                                                                                                                                        
  - Move from “data closed loop” (collect → label → retrain → redeploy) to **goal‑driven training** inside a world model.[1]                                                            
  - Goals: safety, comfort, handling rare events (officer gestures, fireworks, ships, strange obstacles).[2][1]                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Specify how you will approximate this for StreetVision:                                                                                                                             
  - Define target metrics beyond accuracy (e.g., zero false negatives on cones, robust to night/rain).                                                                                  
  - Maintain an **evaluation suite of synthetic edge cases**; retrain until those metrics are met, not just overall accuracy.[file:66dd31e1-ac1a-419b-baf5-03e0faf30e5c][3]             
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  You don’t need real RL yet, but this guarantees the **“training closed loop” idea is captured.**                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ***                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## 2. Extend the Synthetic Data section with world‑model ideas                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Your plan already uses SDXL/Cosmos; add one paragraph that:                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Mentions Kun’s **3DGS + generative** world model stack (DrivingSphere, Omni, RLGF) as the long‑term direction for “real + generative + multi‑agent” simulation.[1][2]               
  - States explicitly: “current implementation uses SDXL / Cosmos; future upgrade: plug into AV‑style world models (OpenDriveLab, NVIDIA AV stack) to generate                          
  **trajectory‑consistent** synthetic sequences, not only single images.”[4][5]                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  This keeps the plan compatible with **future RL/world‑model training.**                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ***                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## 3. Add a short “VLA‑0 Principle” note in the model architecture                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  In the model section (where you describe DINOv3 / Qwen / Florence cascade), add a small subsection:                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Cite Ankit Goyal’s **“Keep it simple when building VLAs”**: treat actions as text tokens on top of a VLM, do not modify the backbone.[6][7]                                         
  - Map this onto your stack:                                                                                                                                                           
  - Your “decision” (roadwork / no‑roadwork, or later richer driving commands) is represented as **language tokens or short strings**, trained with standard classification /           
  language losses.                                                                                                                                                                      
  - You explicitly **avoid bespoke control heads**, following VLA‑0’s simplicity principle.[file:56b22c4b-5117-48f3-bfc7-1b01dc6507c1][8]                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  That ensures your architecture section reflects **all VLA‑related insights.**                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ***                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## 4. Add an “ICCV25 Learning‑to‑See & OpenDriveLab Alignment” appendix                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Create a brief appendix that lists the external anchors you want to stay aligned with:                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Kun Zhan’s world‑model talk (ICCV25 “Learning to See”) and its three pillars: regional‑scale simulation, synthetic data, RL engine.[9][10]                                          
  - Ankit Goyal’s VLA‑0 talk and the “no custom action head” design rule.[6][9]                                                                                                         
  - Mention that your plan is designed so the same infrastructure (synthetic generation, active learning, world‑model hooks) can later be reused for:                                   
  - driving‑oriented VLAs,                                                                                                                                                              
  - city‑scale egocentric SLAM / spatial AI benchmarks like LaMAria / Project Aria.[11][12]                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  This appendix is mainly to **not lose the ICCV workshop context.**                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ***                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## 5. Add a tiny checklist at the very top                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  To make the plan “non‑stop complete”, add a **1‑page checklist** at the beginning with items referencing your sections:                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Infrastructure & mining setup (GPU, subnet registration, Docker).                                                                                                                   
  - Core model stack (DINOv3 + ensemble, cascade).                                                                                                                                      
  - Data pipeline (NATIX + synthetic + FiftyOne hard‑case mining).                                                                                                                      
  - Retraining cadence & 90‑day decay handling.                                                                                                                                         
  - Monitoring & debugging.                                                                                                                                                             
  - Security & wallet protection.

  Mark each item with the section title so you can literally **tick through the entire system end‑to‑end**.

  If you want, the next step can be: paste the latest `REALISTIC_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md` and this answer side‑by‑side, and a consolidated version can be produced that already includes     
  these new sections so you have **one single “final” document.**

  [12](https://iccv.thecvf.com/Conferences/2025/Videos) You don’t need a totally new plan; you need to **merge everything** into one “master index” and then plug the ICCV25 /          
  OpenDriveLab pieces into it.

Core goals and constraints                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  You already covered:                                                                                                                                                                  
  - Target: **StreetVision Subnet 72** – roadwork detection now, later more infrastructure tasks.[1][2]                                                                                 
  - Constraints: 90‑day model decay, need high accuracy on mixed real + synthetic, cost ceiling per month.[file:66dd31e1-ac1a-419b-baf5-03e0faf30e5c]                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Make sure your plan explicitly states:                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - **Primary goal:** top‑5 miner within 2–3 months, with stable uptime and auto‑retraining.                                                                                            
  - **Secondary goal:** architecture/general pipeline re‑usable for future driving / VLA / spatial AI tasks (alignment with OpenDriveLab & ICCV25).

  You have: candidate GPUs and cost envelopes, basic mining requirements (low latency, no timeouts).[file:66dd31e1-ac1a-419b-baf5-03e0faf30e5c]                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Ensure the plan includes:                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - **Concrete GPU choice** for v1: e.g. single RTX 3090 / 4090 (24 GB) or A100 40 GB with target latency < 100 ms per image.                                                           
  - **Hosting decision:** which provider (RunPod / Vast / Lambda) and how you’ll ensure 24/7 uptime.                                                                                    
  - **Docker + system layout:** one container for model inference + miner client; logs shipped to a small monitoring service.

  Also insert the **“VLA‑0 principle”** here:

ICCV25 “Learning to See” & OpenDriveLab alignment                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  This is the part you now want to integrate on top of all of the above.                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Add a dedicated section near the end, for example “Alignment with ICCV25 Learning‑to‑See & OpenDriveLab”:                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ### 7.1 World‑model / closed‑loop ideas (Kun Zhan)                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Capture the idea of **moving from data closed loop to training closed loop**:                                                                                                       
  - You train policies inside a high‑fidelity world model / simulator, with RL‑style rewards, until goals are satisfied.[8][9][10]                                                      
  - Note three pillars of their world model:                                                                                                                                            
  - Large‑scale 3DGS reconstruction (real scenes).                                                                                                                                      
  - Generative modules (DrivingSphere, Omni, RLGF) for rare/long‑tail scenarios.                                                                                                        
  - Simulation + RL engine with smart multi‑agent traffic, reward models (RHF, RxVR, RLF).[9][10][11]                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Then write how your plan **connects**:                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Today: you use SDXL / Cosmos + FiftyOne as a “poor man’s world model” for single‑image tasks.                                                                                       
  - Future: you plan to integrate with AV‑style simulators and world models (OpenDriveLab challenges, NVIDIA AV world models) to generate **trajectory‑consistent** data and            
  possibly train RL‑style policies.                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ### 7.2 VLA simplicity (Ankit Goyal)                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Summarize VLA‑0: actions as text tokens on top of an off‑the‑shelf VLM; no custom action head.[12][7]                                                                               
  - Connect to your plan:                                                                                                                                                               
  - Your decision layer (roadwork / no roadwork now; more complex actions later) sits **on top of a generic vision / vision‑language backbone**, matching this philosophy.              
  - If later StreetVision adds more complex driving‑action tasks, you will follow this design instead of inventing a heavy bespoke controller.

  Add 2–3 sentences that:                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Acknowledge that OpenDriveLab’s workshop focuses on **embodied spatial understanding, VLAs, simulation from real‑world data**.[12][8]                                               
  - State that your pipeline (synthetic data, DINOv3 backbones, active learning, alignment with world models) is designed so you can **reuse everything** when StreetVision moves       
  beyond roadwork into richer scene understanding / actions.                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ***                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## 8. What is still missing                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  After you add the above sections, the only things that may still be light are:                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - A **top‑level one‑page checklist** (so you can see if every aspect is implemented).                                                                                                 
  - A very short “Risks & Failure modes” list (timeouts, under‑training, bad synthetic quality, overfitting to validator distribution) and how you mitigate each.                       
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  You can base this on your own failure‑mode lists from `LastPlan.md` and `COMPLETE_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md`, compressed into 5–7

  If you want, the next step can be: copy‑paste the latest `REALISTIC_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md` content here and a merged, single “COMPLETEST MASTER PLAN” document can be produced that      
  already includes all these additions in the right places.

  [24](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3N9otbGBVLdiX50gDxYzxNvjRXsPw6cB) You should keep your core StreetVision plan, but add three concrete upgrades informed by Yann          
  LeCun, SAM 3, Molmo 2, vLLM video, and Modular’s small‑GPU story.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  1. Backbone choice (Yann LeCun + JEPA ideas)                                                                                                                                          
  LeCun’s core points that matter for you: world models should predict in abstract representation space, not pixels, and LLMs alone are bad at continuous noisy data like               
  video.youtube​[allenai](https://allenai.org/blog/molmo2)​                                                                                                                             
  Your current choice of DINO‑style image backbone + separate video/VLM model already follows this principle: you learn dense visual features first, then reason on top with a          
  smaller language head.youtube+1​                                                                                                                                                      
  Best action:                                                                                                                                                                          
  Keep DINOv3 (or similar strong vision encoder) as the main 2D backbone; do not replace it with a pure LLM‑only stack.youtube+1​                                                       
  When you add video, use Molmo 2 as a video world‑model head (tracking, counting, temporal reasoning) on top of visual features, not raw pixels or pure

  2. SAM 3 for data + exhaustivity (no RL)                                                                                                                                              
  From the SAM 3 talk and Roboflow docs: SAM 3 adds concept prompts, presence tokens, and a data engine that already produced 100M+ smart polygons and ~130 years of label time         
  saved.[roboflow](https://blog.roboflow.com/what-is-sam3/)​youtube​                                                                                                                    
  It segments images and videos with text prompts like “orange traffic cone” or “excavator” and can be fine‑tuned or used just to label data for a smaller RF‑DETR/YOLO‑type

  Best way for you to use SAM 3 (no RL):                                                                                                                                                
  Month 2+: use SAM 3 only for hard‑case annotation and coverage checks, not online inference.[roboflow](https://blog.roboflow.com/what-is-sam3/)​youtube​                              
  For each validator hard case:                                                                                                                                                         
  Run SAM 3 with prompts: “roadwork sign”, “orange cone”, “construction barrier”, “worker in vest”, “construction

  Let the SAM 3 + Roboflow verifier pipeline filter masks; you just correct the few misses.[roboflow](https://blog.roboflow.com/what-is-sam3/)​

  Train / refine your RF‑DETR or YOLO detector.[roboflow](https://blog.roboflow.com/what-is-sam3/)​                                                                                     
  Compute “did we find all objects?” checks to catch under‑detections in your cascade.youtube​

  No need for constant human annotation (cost reduction)                                                                                                                                
  Best‑case action:

  Add those three sections + the tool policies I outlined earlier, and your plan is genuinely best‑case for December 20, 2025.To push toward 99% accuracy and a genuinely “pro”         
  2025 setup, you need to upgrade three fronts at once: model, data, and evaluation/closed‑loop. Here is the minimal, concrete path.                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  1. Model stack for 99%                                                                                                                                                                
  Use DINOv3‑Base or Large as your primary backbone; it is the strongest open vision model as of late 2025 and explicitly designed for mixed real/synthetic

  Start with frozen backbone + 2–4 layer MLP head for binary roadwork; only go to full fine‑tuning if you hit a ceiling.                                                                
  Add one ensemble partner:                                                                                                                                                             
  Either ConvNeXt‑V2 (fast CNN) or SigLIP2 (better on weird synthetic / text‑like scenes).[lightly+1](https://www.lightly.ai/blog/dinov3)​                                              
  Use uncertainty‑aware fusion:                                                                                                                                                         
  For confident DINOv3 predictions, trust DINOv3.                                                                                                                                       
  For borderline cases (0.3–0.7), combine both models (average logits or a small learned fusion head).

  2. Data & synthetic at “world‑model level”                                                                                                                                            
  To get anywhere near 99%, model choice is less important than data and coverage:                                                                                                      
  Treat your synthetic setup as a mini world model:

  Always condition prompts on hard cases mined from validators (via FiftyOne), not random imagination.                                                                                  
  Maintain balanced distributions:                                                                                                                                                      
  Match real vs synthetic roughly 50/50 during training.                                                                                                                                
  Over‑sample rare conditions (night, heavy rain, dense traffic) until their validation error matches daytime error.                                                                    
  Continuously curate:                                                                                                                                                                  
  Routinely delete low‑quality, unrealistic, or mislabeled synthetic samples; bad synthetic hurts more than no synthetic.                                                               
  Think like Kun Zhan’s world model, but in 2D: the goal is coverage of all nasty edge cases, not just more images.youtube+1​

  Accuracy climbs when your model sees exactly the things it is bad at:

  For each cluster:                                                                                                                                                                     
  Generate 10–50 synthetic variants (different weather, light, offsets).                                                                                                                
  Retrain the head or a small adapter for 1–3 epochs.

  Evaluate on a fixed “challenge set” of your worst historical failures; if the score doesn’t improve, do not deploy.                                                                   
  This is your training closed loop: you are not just collecting more data; you are pushing the model until it solves concrete failure modes.youtube+1​

  To reach and maintain very high accuracy, you need a strict routine:

  Freeze decay by training a fresh head or lightly fine‑tuned backbone on the full curated dataset (real + synthetic + hardest cases).

  This index summarizes every core concept, tool, and strategy covered in this chat session to ensure nothing is missed in your final plan.                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ### 1. The Core Objective (StreetVision Subnet 72)                                                                                                                                    
  - **Goal:** Become a top-5 miner (99% accuracy) on Subnet 72 (Roadwork Detection).                                                                                                    
  - **Task:** Binary classification (Roadwork vs. No-Roadwork) on street images.                                                                                                        
  - **Constraints:**                                                                                                                                                                    
  - **90-day model decay:** Models lose reward weight after 90 days; must retrain/upload new.                                                                                           
  - **Latency:** < 100ms inference required.                                                                                                                                            
  - **Validator Data:** Mix of real (NATIX dataset) and ~50% synthetic (adversarial/edge-case) images.                                                                                  
  - **Cost:** Efficient GPU usage (e.g., RTX 3090/4090 or A100).                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ### 2. The Winning Model Stack (v1 & Future)                                                                                                                                          
  - **Primary Backbone (v1):** **DINOv3-Base** (frozen or lightly fine-tuned).                                                                                                          
  - *Why:* Best OOD robustness, Gram anchoring for synthetic stability.                                                                                                                 
  - *Head:* Simple 2-4 layer MLP classifier.                                                                                                                                            
  - **Ensemble Partner (Optional):** **ConvNeXt-V2** or **SigLIP2**.                                                                                                                    
  - *Role:* Complementary robustness; handles text-heavy synthetic scenes better.                                                                                                       
  - *Fusion:* Uncertainty-aware weighted average (trust DINOv3 on confident, average on borderline 0.3-0.7).                                                                            
  - **"VLA-0 Principle" (Ankit Goyal):**                                                                                                                                                
  - Keep action/decision layers simple (text tokens/labels) on top of strong vision backbones. Avoid bespoke control heads.                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ### 3. The Data Engine (World-Model Style)                                                                                                                                            
  - **Real Data:** NATIX dataset as foundation.                                                                                                                                         
  - **Synthetic Data (The "World Model"):**                                                                                                                                             
  - Use SDXL/Cosmos to generate targeted edge cases (night, rain, fog, weird cones).                                                                                                    
  - *Goal:* 50/50 mix of real vs. synthetic.                                                                                                                                            
  - *Future Alignment (Kun Zhan):* Move toward 3DGS reconstruction + generative simulation for trajectory-consistent data.                                                              
  - **Active Learning (The "Closed Loop"):**                                                                                                                                            
  - **Tool:** **FiftyOne**.                                                                                                                                                             
  - *Daily Loop:* Log predictions -> Mine hard cases (wrong/low-confidence) -> Cluster -> Generate synthetic variants -> Retrain.                                                       
  - *Outcome:* Model learns from its own failures daily.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ### 4. Training Strategy & Discipline                                                                                                                                                 
  - **Daily Loop:** Small updates on mined hard cases (1-3 epochs).                                                                                                                     
  - **Major Cycle (~60 Days):** Full retrain/refresh on curated dataset (Real + Synthetic + Hard Cases) to reset decay timer.                                                           
  - **Curriculum Learning:** Start easy (clean real images), gradually add hard/synthetic cases.                                                                                        
  - **Hard Negative Mining:** Explicitly target false positives/negatives.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ### 5. Infrastructure & Ops                                                                                                                                                           
  - **Hardware:** Single **RTX 3090 / 4090** (24GB VRAM) is sufficient for v1.                                                                                                          
  - **Deployment:** Docker container (Inference + Miner Client).

  > **Design Philosophy (VLA-0 Principle):** Following Ankit Goyal's ICCV25 insights, we keep the decision layer minimal. Actions (Roadwork/No-Roadwork) are treated as simple          
  label tokens on top of a strong, frozen vision backbone (DINOv3). We avoid complex, bespoke control heads to ensure modularity and scalability.

  ### 7.1 From Data Loop to Training Closed Loop (Kun Zhan)                                                                                                                             
  - **Current (v1):** We use FiftyOne + SDXL to manually close the data loop (mine failure -> gen synthetic -> retrain).                                                                
  - **Future (v2):** We will integrate with AV-style World Models (e.g., 3DGS reconstruction + Generative Simulators) to generate trajectory-consistent synthetic data. Training        
  will become goal-driven (e.g., "minimize safety violations") rather than just accuracy-driven.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ### 7.2 Generative World Model Integration                                                                                                                                            
  - We treat our synthetic data engine not just as an augmentor, but as a "Mini World Model" designed to simulate rare, long-tail scenarios (night, extreme weather, weird              
  occlusions) that real data misses. This ensures robust generalization beyond the training set.                                                                                        
  ```

  static accuracy.

  - **Principle:** We stick to "Actions as Tokens." Even for complex future tasks (e.g., "Drive Safely"), we will output simple text tokens on top of our strong visual backbone,       
  avoiding complex bespoke controllers.

  - **Tech:** Leverage **Glomap** for global mapping and **Gaussian Splatting** for dense reconstruction.                                                                               
  - **Application:** Use these 3D priors to generate better synthetic training data (Novel View Synthesis) for our DINOv3 model.

  ## What these OpenDriveLab videos give you                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - They define the **target future**: city‑scale 3D reconstruction, generative world models (3DGS + diffusion), and training closed loops for driving.[3][4]                           
  - They show how to use **Driving world models** (e.g., DriveAGI) as the backbone for simulation‑driven training, not just single‑image classifiers.[5]                                
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  For StreetVision now, that means:                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Stay with **DINOv3** + small head as your main miner (you already planned this).[6]                                                                                                 
  - Design your data/synthetic/active‑learning loop so it can later plug into **OpenDriveLab‑style world models** (3DGS, Glomap, DriveAGI) instead of SDXL only.[4][7]                  
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## What you should do next (concrete)                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  1. **Add one short “OpenDriveLab Alignment” section** to your plan:                                                                                                                   
  - Mention “Learning to See: Advancing Spatial Understanding for Embodied Intelligence” and list: world model, spatial AI, VLAs as the long‑term direction.[8][2]                      
  - State that your StreetVision miner is built so the backbone + data engine can be reused with DriveAGI / OpenDriveLab stacks later.[5]                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  2. **In your synthetic data section**, add 2–3 sentences:                                                                                                                             
  - Today: SDXL/Cosmos generating 2D edge cases.                                                                                                                                        
  - Future: replace/augment with **3DGS‑based scene generators** (like the 3D city work in EARTH‑3D / Skyfall‑GS) to get multi‑view, trajectory‑consistent samples.[7][9]               
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  3. **In your “future work” / “Phase 4”**, write:                                                                                                                                      
  - Integrate an **OpenDriveLab driving world model** (DriveAGI or successors) as the source of rare‑scenario data and as an evaluation environment for closed‑loop testing,            
  following Kun Zhan’s “from data closed‑loop to training closed‑loop” idea.[3][4][5]                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  If you paste your current REALISTIC_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN section around “future work” or “ICCV alignment,” a very tight, ready‑to‑paste “OpenDriveLab alignment” block can be written      
  directly into it.

  [22](https://www.worldlabs.ai/blog) To be “the best of both” Kun Zhan and OpenDriveLab for StreetVision, you should not copy their huge systems; you should **mount your small        
  miner on top of their ecosystem** and use their assets where they give you real edge.

  - Add **one** extra model for robustness:                                                                                                                                             
  - SigLIP2 or ConvNeXt‑V2 for weird synthetic / text‑heavy scenes.                                                                                                                     
  - Keep output as **tokens/labels**, matching Kun Zhan’s VLA roadmap and Doe‑1’s token‑based scene representation.[3][4]                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  You are then using the same style of strong vision encoder + tokenized actions that Kun Zhan’s team and Doe‑1 use (just much smaller).[5][3]                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ***                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## 2. Stand on OpenDriveLab’s shoulders instead of rebuilding them                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  OpenDriveLab has already done the heavy lifting:                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - **DriveAGI** repo: foundation driving models, OpenDV video dataset, OpenLane‑V2 maps.[6][7]                                                                                         
  - **Doe‑1 GitHub**: closed‑loop world model with observation/description/action tokens and unified driving tasks.[4][5]                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  What you can realistically do:                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  1. **Use their data and representations, not train their models from scratch.**                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Download **OpenDV‑mini** subset (tens of GB, not 24 TB) from DriveAGI and use it to:                                                                                                
  - Pretrain or validate your DINOv3 features on driving scenes.[6]                                                                                                                     
  - Build a small internal “challenge set” of roadwork‑like scenes (cones, lane closures) from OpenDV‑mini.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  2. **Borrow their scene structure ideas.**                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Study DriveAGI’s tasks (prediction, planning, lane topology) and Doe‑1’s observation / description / action token format.[5][6]                                                     
  - In your own data pipeline, log for each StreetVision sample:                                                                                                                        
  - Observation: raw image + DINOv3 embedding.                                                                                                                                          
  - Description: short text caption (e.g., “two cones and one excavator in right lane”).                                                                                                
  - Action: binary label (roadwork yes/no).                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  That keeps your miner’s logs formatted like a **mini Doe‑1 dataset**, which is powerful for future upgrades.[4][5]                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ***                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## 3. Turn your active‑learning loop into a small closed‑loop trainer                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  From Kun Zhan, Doe‑1, AD‑R1, WoW! and similar work, the pattern is: world model + closed‑loop RL or GRPO‑style policy updates.[8][9][10]                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  For StreetVision, the maximal but feasible version is:                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - **Teacher–student self‑learning (GRPO‑style but light):**                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Teacher: the last deployed DINOv3 model (EMA copy).                                                                                                                                 
  - Student: new model trained on hard cases + synthetic.                                                                                                                               
  - Training set each week:                                                                                                                                                             
  - Hard cases where teacher was wrong.

  - Filter out samples where the new model becomes over‑confident too fast (very low entropy), inspired by M‑GRPO / AD‑R1 ideas.[8]

  - For each mined failure mode cluster (e.g., night + cones + rain), generate many SDXL variants.                                                                                      
  - Optionally, sample **driving clips** from OpenDV‑mini or DriveAGI that look similar and use them to validate that your model is robust under motion.[11][6]                         
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  You are not training a full RL policy, but you are following the **same closed‑loop shape**: observe → simulate synthetic variants → update → check on challenge set.[9][10]

  - Implement a **teacher–student self‑learning step** with EMA + entropy filtering, inspired by GRPO/AD‑R1, for your weekly retrain.[10][8]                                            
  - Build a fixed “challenge set” of your nastiest failures and require improvements on it for every new model version.[2]

  - Download **OpenDV‑mini** from DriveAGI, and run small experiments:                                                                                                                  
  - Train or fine‑tune your DINOv3 head on a mixture of NATIX + OpenDV‑mini roadwork‑like frames.[6]                                                                                    
  - Compare performance with NATIX‑only training.                                                                                                                                       
  - Export embeddings and labels in a Doe‑1‑style “observation/description/action” format so your dataset can later be used with closed‑loop world models.[4][5]                        
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  If you execute this, you will not just be a strong StreetVision miner; you will be the miner whose pipeline looks most like a **small, applied version of Kun Zhan + OpenDriveLab     
  world‑model research**, which is exactly what you want.

  **a) Core model stack**                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Make **DINOv3‑Base (or Large)** your primary backbone, with:                                                                                                                        
  - Frozen or lightly fine‑tuned encoder.                                                                                                                                               
  - 2–4 layer MLP head for roadwork / no‑roadwork.[1][2]                                                                                                                                
  - Add **one** extra model for robustness:                                                                                                                                             
  - SigLIP2 or ConvNeXt‑V2 for weird synthetic / text‑heavy scenes.                                                                                                                     
  - Keep output as **tokens/labels**, matching Kun Zhan’s VLA roadmap and Doe‑1’s token‑based scene representation.[3][4]                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  You are then using the same style of strong vision encoder + tokenized actions that Kun Zhan’s team and Doe‑1 use (just much smaller).[5][3]                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ***                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## 2. Stand on OpenDriveLab’s shoulders instead of rebuilding them                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  OpenDriveLab has already done the heavy lifting:                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - **DriveAGI** repo: foundation driving models, OpenDV video dataset, OpenLane‑V2 maps.[6][7]                                                                                         
  - **Doe‑1 GitHub**: closed‑loop world model with observation/description/action tokens and unified driving tasks.[4][5]                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  What you can realistically do:                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  1. **Use their data and representations, not train their models from scratch.**                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Download **OpenDV‑mini** subset (tens of GB, not 24 TB) from DriveAGI and use it to:                                                                                                
  - Pretrain or validate your DINOv3 features on driving scenes.[6]                                                                                                                     
  - Build a small internal “challenge set” of roadwork‑like scenes (cones, lane closures) from OpenDV‑mini.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  2. **Borrow their scene structure ideas.**                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Study DriveAGI’s tasks (prediction, planning, lane topology) and Doe‑1’s observation / description / action token format.[5][6]                                                     
  - In your own data pipeline, log for each StreetVision sample:                                                                                                                        
  - Observation: raw image + DINOv3 embedding.                                                                                                                                          
  - Description: short text caption (e.g., “two cones and one excavator in right lane”).                                                                                                
  - Action: binary label (roadwork yes/no).                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  That keeps your miner’s logs formatted like a **mini Doe‑1 dataset**, which is powerful for future upgrades.[4][5]                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ***                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## 3. Turn your active‑learning loop into a small closed‑loop trainer                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  From Kun Zhan, Doe‑1, AD‑R1, WoW! and similar work, the pattern is: world model + closed‑loop RL or GRPO‑style policy updates.[8][9][10]                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  For StreetVision, the maximal but feasible version is:                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - **Teacher–student self‑learning (GRPO‑style but light):**                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Teacher: the last deployed DINOv3 model (EMA copy).

  - Implement a **teacher–student self‑learning step** with EMA + entropy filtering, inspired by GRPO/AD‑R1, for your weekly retrain.[10][8]                                            
  - Build a fixed “challenge set” of your nastiest failures and require improvements on it for every new model version.[2]

  - Download **OpenDV‑mini** from DriveAGI, and run small experiments:                                                                                                                  
  - Train or fine‑tune your DINOv3 head on a mixture of NATIX + OpenDV‑mini roadwork‑like frames.[6]                                                                                    
  - Compare performance with NATIX‑only training.                                                                                                                                       
  - Export embeddings and labels in a Doe‑1‑style “observation/description/action” format so your dataset can later be used with closed‑loop world models.[4][5]                        
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  If you execute this, you will not just be a strong StreetVision miner; you will be the miner whose pipeline looks most like a **small, applied version of Kun Zhan + OpenDriveLab     
  world‑model research**, which is exactly what you want.

  [28](https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/DriveAGI/labels?sort=count-desc) Yes, it is okay, and in fact a very strong move, to use OpenDriveLab’s own AGI models from **DriveAGI** as      
  long as you respect their license and have enough compute.

Legality and “is it allowed?”                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - **DriveAGI is open source** under the license in its repo. You are allowed to:                                                                                                      
  - Clone the code,                                                                                                                                                                     
  - Run their pretrained models,                                                                                                                                                        
  - Fine‑tune on your own data,                                                                                                                                                         
  - Integrate features into your StreetVision miner,                                                                                                                                    
  as long as you follow the license terms (usually attribution and non‑misuse).[1][2]                                                                                                   
  - From a StreetVision / NATIX side there is no restriction against using external open‑source models; they only care about accuracy, latency, and uptime.[3][4]                       
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  So yes: **you can legally run DriveAGI models and use them in your miner**.                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ***                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## 2. Should you replace your StreetVision model with DriveAGI?                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  For Subnet 72 (single‑image roadwork classification), the best practical approach is:                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Keep **DINOv3‑Base + MLP** as the main StreetVision head (fast, simple, easy to fine‑tune on NATIX).[5][6]                                                                          
  - Use **DriveAGI models as powerful feature extractors or teachers**, not as the primary live classifier.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Reasons:                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - DriveAGI models are heavier, designed for multi‑task driving (perception/prediction/planning), and may be overkill / too slow to run on every StreetVision image.[7][1]             
  - You control DINOv3 fine‑tuning and quantization much more easily for latency and 24/7 reliability.                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ***                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## 3. Best “pro” way to use DriveAGI with StreetVision                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  A strong setup that *does* use their AGI models:                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  1. **Offline teacher / feature extractor**                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Run one of DriveAGI’s pretrained perception heads (e.g., BEV or scene encoder) on:                                                                                                  
  - A subset of NATIX images,                                                                                                                                                           
  - Your hardest StreetVision failures,                                                                                                                                                 
  - Some OpenDV samples.[1]                                                                                                                                                             
  - Extract high‑level features or pseudo‑labels (e.g., lane topology, free space, object heatmaps).                                                                                    
  - Train your **DINOv3 head** to match or use these signals (distillation), so your StreetVision model inherits some “driving awareness” from DriveAGI without running it live.        
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  2. **Evaluation / challenge set**                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Use DriveAGI data and models to build a **“pro challenge set”**:                                                                                                                    
  - Scenes with complex traffic + roadwork‑like patterns.                                                                                                                               
  - Always evaluate new StreetVision models on this set to check real‑world robustness.[7][1]                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  3. **Optional: low‑rate live cascade**                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - For a small fraction of StreetVision queries (e.g., 1–5% of ambiguous ones), you *can* send the image (or a short frame sequence) through a lighter DriveAGI perception             
  model and combine its output with your DINOv3 classifier.                                                                                                                             
  - This gives you “DriveAGI‑level” reasoning on the hardest cases without blowing up latency and cost.

  ## 4. When *not* to use DriveAGI directly                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Avoid making DriveAGI your primary live miner model if:                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - It does not meet StreetVision latency (<100 ms) on your 3090/4090.                                                                                                                  
  - It requires too much VRAM / multi‑GPU to run reliably 24/7.                                                                                                                         
  - Fine‑tuning it for your very specific binary task is harder than keeping it as a teacher.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  In that situation, your miner is best as:                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - **Production:** DINOv3 + small head (and maybe SigLIP2/YOLO helper).                                                                                                                
  - **Research/teacher:** DriveAGI + Doe‑1 world‑model code used offline to improve your training data, features, and evaluation.[8][1]                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ***                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  So: using **DriveAGI** is not only “ok”, it is one of the strongest ways to be more “pro” and closer to Kun Zhan / OpenDriveLab—just keep it as a **teacher and backbone for          
  research**, while your StreetVision miner remains a lean, DINOv3‑based production model tuned for speed and uptime.

  discussions (Modular, SGLang, vLLM, SAM 3, Molmo 2, DriveAGI, Kun Zhan / OpenDriveLab, etc.). Below is that checklist, grouped by where it goes in your plans.

  - Limit to the hardest 5–10% of video queries to stay within latency and GPU budget.[9][10]

  - Describe **Marengo 3.0** as a **long‑video embedding & retrieval engine**, not your main classifier.[11][12]

  - Break long videos into ~6‑second segments and embed them with Marengo (1024‑D multimodal vectors).[13][14]                                                                          
  - Use semantic search (“night roadwork with flashing lights”, “new cones placed”) to find candidate segments, then send only those clips to Molmo‑2 / DINOv3.[14][15]

  - Make **FiftyOne + FiftyOne Brain** the center of your active‑learning loop.[16][3]

  - Use embeddings + “hardness” scores to mine the hardest StreetVision samples (wrong or high‑uncertainty) each day.[3]                                                                
  - Visualize clusters of failure modes and pick batches for SDXL/SAM‑3 annotation and retraining.                                                                                      
  - Optionally mention the **Active Learning plugin** for automating uncertainty‑based querying.[17][18]

  If you drop one short “Omni + Molmo‑2 + Marengo + FiftyOne stack” subsection with these bullets into your ULTIMATE plan, you will fully capture what those YouTube talks are          
  doing, but tailored to StreetVision.

  To make REALISTIC_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md “best‑case and complete,” add:                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  1. A short **“Tool Policies”** section that, for each item in your table, spells out:                                                                                                 
  - When it is enabled (by month and by revenue)                                                                                                                                        
  - On which hardware (3090 vs 4090 vs H100)                                                                                                                                            
  - Any usage caps (Marengo, Molmo, Omni)[16][20][1]                                                                                                                                    
  2. A **precision table** for TensorRT/AutoAWQ so models have fixed FP16/FP8/INT4 settings.[11][10][2]                                                                                 
  3. One **Mojo/MAX kernel commitment** (DINOv3 pre‑proc using 2D map pattern).[5][2]                                                                                                   
  4. Version pins and upgrade criteria for **FiftyOne + Enterprise** and a note about supported Python/Mongo.[18][19][17][2]                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Once those are written in, your table of 12 “missing” items is fully resolved and the plan becomes a **coherent, best‑case December 20, 2025 stack**, not just a list of tools.

  [39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7bIdv2FQzY)  The remaining gaps now are not more named tools, but **how you use them together at “best‑case” level**: Omni/Modular/Mojo,        
  TensorRT/quant, and data tools all need one more layer of detail.

  Your plan lists Modular MAX and links Mojo GPU puzzles, but it never states **a concrete use** of Mojo kernels in the StreetVision miner.[1][2][3][4]                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Missing points:                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - A specific kernel target:                                                                                                                                                           
  - Use a Mojo 2D **map** kernel (like Puzzle 04) for image pre‑processing: resize, normalization, simple augmentations, or per‑pixel masks before DINOv3.[1]                           
  - This fits exactly the 2D‑thread indexing + bounds‑check pattern from the tutorial.[1]                                                                                               
  - Integration decision:                                                                                                                                                               
  - Clarify that **Stage 1 DINOv3 pre‑proc** can be moved from PyTorch CPU to a Mojo GPU kernel to cut a few ms per image.[3][1]                                                        
  - State that you only do this **after** basic cascade is stable (Month 2+), so you do not block MVP.[5]                                                                               
  - Hardware portability:                                                                                                                                                               
  - If you ever move to AMD or Apple GPUs, MAX Engine lets the same Mojo kernels run cross‑vendor.[2][6]                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Right now the documents mention Mojo/MAX but never promise a **single concrete kernel**; adding that makes the story complete.[3][5][1]

  You mention TensorRT and AutoAWQ, but there is no **single canonical recipe** for precisions per model in the realistic plan.[7][8][5][3]

  You already list vLLM‑Omni, Molmo‑2, and TwelveLabs Marengo 3.0, but you still lack **hard usage policies** so “best‑case” does not become “blow up the bill.”[9][10][11][3][5]

  - Months 1–2: **image‑only**; omnivideo stack fully disabled.[5]                                                                                                                      
  - Month 3+ (only if profitable): enable a tiny “video path” using Marengo 3.0 + Molmo‑2‑8B for at most, e.g., 5 % of queries.[12][9][3]                                               
  - Hard numeric caps:                                                                                                                                                                  
  - Marengo: max 300 minutes/month (≈12 USD) until miner >1 500 USD/month.[13][12][5]                                                                                                   
  - Molmo: QPS cap (e.g. 0.1–0.2 requests/s) so it cannot starve the GPU.[14][15][3]

  ## FiftyOne “best‑case” settings                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  You use FiftyOne conceptually, but for a best‑case plan you can still add **two small but important details**.[16][17][3]

  - Pin open‑source to a current release (e.g. `fiftyone==0.22.x`, released Dec 2025) for better performance and newer Mongo support, instead of older 1.11 examples.[17][16]           
  - MongoDB compatibility:                                                                                                                                                              
  - Note the deprecation warning: new FiftyOne releases may drop support for older MongoDB (≤6.0), so best case is to run a supported Mongo version from day one.[18]                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  That makes the data/active‑learning stack future‑proof instead of “it might break later.”[16][18]

  Putting all research together, what is still missing in the best stack:                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  1. **One explicit Mojo/MAX kernel target** (2D map pre‑proc for DINOv3) and when you add it.[3][1]                                                                                    
  2. **A precision table** (FP16/FP8/INT4) per model with AutoAWQ/TensorRT roles, not just names.[7][8][3]                                                                              
  3. **Strict policies and caps** for Omni + Molmo + Marengo usage tied to revenue thresholds.[10][11][9][5]                                                                            
  4. **FiftyOne version + Mongo requirement** for the latest 2025 releases instead of just “FiftyOne.”[18][17][16]                                                                      
  5. A short note that **Month‑1 MVP = no NGINX/Redis/SGLang/Omni/Marengo**, just a single 3090 cascade, and those extras only appear once you hit clear profitability                  
  triggers.[4][5]                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Once you add those five items explicitly into REALISTIC_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md, your plan is aligned with **the latest December 20, 2025 ecosystem** and uses Modular/MAX, Mojo,          
  TensorRT, AutoAWQ, FiftyOne, TwelveLabs, vLLM‑Omni, and Molmo‑2 in a controlled, best‑case way.[15][11][12][7][1][3][5]

  ***                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## 1. Backbone choice (Yann LeCun + JEPA ideas)                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  LeCun’s core points that matter for you: world models should predict in **abstract representation space**, not pixels, and LLMs alone are bad at continuous noisy data like           
  video.[1][2]                                                                                                                                                                          
  Your current choice of DINO‑style image backbone + separate video/VLM model already follows this principle: you learn dense visual features first, then reason on top with a          
  smaller language head.[3][1]                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Best action:                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Keep DINOv3 (or similar strong vision encoder) as the **main 2D backbone**; do not replace it with a pure LLM‑only stack.[1][3]                                                     
  - When you add video, use Molmo 2 as a **video world‑model head** (tracking, counting, temporal reasoning) on top of visual features, not raw pixels or pure text.[2][4]              
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ***                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## 2. SAM 3 for data + exhaustivity (no RL)                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  From the SAM 3 talk and Roboflow docs: SAM 3 adds **concept prompts**, presence tokens, and a data engine that already produced 100M+ smart polygons and ~130 years of label time     
  saved.[5][3]                                                                                                                                                                          
  It segments images and videos with text prompts like “orange traffic cone” or “excavator” and can be fine‑tuned or used just to label data for a smaller RF‑DETR/YOLO‑type            
  model.[6][5]                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Best way for you to use SAM 3 (no RL):                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Month 2+: use SAM 3 only for **hard‑case annotation and coverage checks**, not online inference.[5][1]                                                                              
  - For each validator hard case:                                                                                                                                                       
  - Run SAM 3 with prompts: “roadwork sign”, “orange cone”, “construction barrier”, “worker in vest”, “construction vehicle”.[6][5]                                                     
  - Let the SAM 3 + Roboflow verifier pipeline filter masks; you just correct the few misses.[5]                                                                                        
  - Use SAM 3 masks to:                                                                                                                                                                 
  - Train / refine your RF‑DETR or YOLO detector.[5]                                                                                                                                    
  - Compute “did we find all objects?” checks to catch under‑detections in your cascade.[3]                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  This matches LeCun’s view: use strong vision models and self‑supervised representations, not human‑in‑the‑loop RL, and you get more robust perception with less manual                
  work.[1][3]                                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ***                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## 3. Molmo 2 + vLLM video + Modular tiny GPU                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Molmo 2 is now the **best open video intelligence model**: it tracks multiple objects, counts events, grounds in pixels and timestamps, and beats proprietary models like Gemini      
  3 on video tracking.[7][4][2]                                                                                                                                                         
  vLLM already supports video input as sequences of frames via its multimodal API, and has docs for the `video` field and multi‑GPU inference.[8][9][10]                                
  Modular MAX (and Mojo kernels) give you a portable, small‑GPU story for pre‑ and post‑processing without depending only on CUDA.[11][12]                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Best integration:                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Short clips (≤5–10 s) from images or validator UI:                                                                                                                                  
  - Use Molmo 2‑8B via vLLM multimodal video API on your 3090/4090 for:

  they connect tightly to each other and to OpenDriveLab’s broader research agenda.[1][2]                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## Kun Zhan: world model & closed-loop                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Presents a **world model–based L4 stack** that moves from a “data closed loop” (collect, label, retrain, redeploy) to a **“training closed loop”** where the on‑device driving      
  policy is trained via reinforcement learning inside a high‑fidelity world model.[3][4]                                                                                                
  - The world model combines:                                                                                                                                                           
  - **Regional‑scale 3DGS reconstruction** of real driving scenes,                                                                                                                      
  - **Generative components** (e.g., DrivingSphere, Omni, RLGF) to create rare/long‑tail conditions, and                                                                                
  - A **simulation + RL engine** with smart multi‑agent traffic, reward models (RHF/RxVR/RLF), and goal‑driven training objectives (safety, comfort, efficiency).[4][3]                 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## Why this matters for VLAs                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - The world model is the **training environment**: it produces long‑horizon, diverse trajectories that a driving policy or a VLA can learn from, beyond what sparse real data can     
  cover (e.g., officer gestures, fireworks, ships crossing, adverse weather).[3][4]                                                                                                     
  - Synthetic data from the world model is explicitly used to **balance the dataset** (e.g., weather, rare events), which is key for generalization of any sensor‑to‑action model,      
  including VLAs.[4][3]                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## Ankit Goyal: keep VLAs simple                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Ankit’s VLA‑0 work shows that **state‑of‑the‑art VLAs can be built by treating actions as text tokens on top of an off‑the‑shelf VLM**, with *no architectural modifications*       
  to the base model.[5]                                                                                                                                                                 
  - The talk argues for **simplicity over bespoke architectures**:                                                                                                                      
  - Use a strong VLM backbone,                                                                                                                                                          
  - Represent actions in language space,                                                                                                                                                
  - Rely on data, prompting, and training strategy instead of custom action heads or complex model surgery.[5]                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## How they fit together                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Kun Zhan’s world model + training closed loop gives you a **powerful data and environment engine** (reconstruction, generative simulation, smart agents, RL rewards).[3][4]         
  - Ankit Goyal’s VLA‑0 gives you a **minimalistic action model** that can sit on top: you can let a simple text‑action VLA learn inside that world model instead of designing a        
  complex bespoke control network.[5]                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  If you say what you want from these videos (high‑level summary, design patterns, or concrete implementation steps), a more targeted 1–2 page synthesis can be built around that.

  [27](https://iccv.thecvf.com/virtual/2025/workshop/2745) You already have a very complete plan in the latest `REALISTIC_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md`; what is missing now are **only a few     
  glue pieces** so that nothing from the last 10–20 messages is lost.[file: e861c690-f80d-44bc-9bd8-85bf0f2945c6]                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Below is exactly what to **add/merge** into that plan.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ***                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## 1. Add a “World‑Model & Closed‑Loop” section                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Add a new top‑level section after synthetic data:                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Explain Kun Zhan’s **training closed loop**:                                                                                                                                        
  - Move from “data closed loop” (collect → label → retrain → redeploy) to **goal‑driven training** inside a world model.[1]                                                            
  - Goals: safety, comfort, handling rare events (officer gestures, fireworks, ships, strange obstacles).[2][1]                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Specify how you will approximate this for StreetVision:                                                                                                                             
  - Define target metrics beyond accuracy (e.g., zero false negatives on cones, robust to night/rain).                                                                                  
  - Maintain an **evaluation suite of synthetic edge cases**; retrain until those metrics are met, not just overall accuracy.[file:66dd31e1-ac1a-419b-baf5-03e0faf30e5c][3]             
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  You don’t need real RL yet, but this guarantees the **“training closed loop” idea is captured.**                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ***                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## 2. Extend the Synthetic Data section with world‑model ideas                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Your plan already uses SDXL/Cosmos; add one paragraph that:                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Mentions Kun’s **3DGS + generative** world model stack (DrivingSphere, Omni, RLGF) as the long‑term direction for “real + generative + multi‑agent” simulation.[1][2]               
  - States explicitly: “current implementation uses SDXL / Cosmos; future upgrade: plug into AV‑style world models (OpenDriveLab, NVIDIA AV stack) to generate                          
  **trajectory‑consistent** synthetic sequences, not only single images.”[4][5]                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  This keeps the plan compatible with **future RL/world‑model training.**                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ***                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## 3. Add a short “VLA‑0 Principle” note in the model architecture                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  In the model section (where you describe DINOv3 / Qwen / Florence cascade), add a small subsection:                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Cite Ankit Goyal’s **“Keep it simple when building VLAs”**: treat actions as text tokens on top of a VLM, do not modify the backbone.[6][7]                                         
  - Map this onto your stack:                                                                                                                                                           
  - Your “decision” (roadwork / no‑roadwork, or later richer driving commands) is represented as **language tokens or short strings**, trained with standard classification /           
  language losses.                                                                                                                                                                      
  - You explicitly **avoid bespoke control heads**, following VLA‑0’s simplicity principle.[file:56b22c4b-5117-48f3-bfc7-1b01dc6507c1][8]                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  That ensures your architecture section reflects **all VLA‑related insights.**                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ***                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## 4. Add an “ICCV25 Learning‑to‑See & OpenDriveLab Alignment” appendix                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Create a brief appendix that lists the external anchors you want to stay aligned with:                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Kun Zhan’s world‑model talk (ICCV25 “Learning to See”) and its three pillars: regional‑scale simulation, synthetic data, RL engine.[9][10]                                          
  - Ankit Goyal’s VLA‑0 talk and the “no custom action head” design rule.[6][9]                                                                                                         
  - Mention that your plan is designed so the same infrastructure (synthetic generation, active learning, world‑model hooks) can later be reused for:                                   
  - driving‑oriented VLAs,                                                                                                                                                              
  - city‑scale egocentric SLAM / spatial AI benchmarks like LaMAria / Project Aria.[11][12]                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  This appendix is mainly to **not lose the ICCV workshop context.**                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ***                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## 5. Add a tiny checklist at the very top                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  To make the plan “non‑stop complete”, add a **1‑page checklist** at the beginning with items referencing your sections:                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Infrastructure & mining setup (GPU, subnet registration, Docker).                                                                                                                   
  - Core model stack (DINOv3 + ensemble, cascade).                                                                                                                                      
  - Data pipeline (NATIX + synthetic + FiftyOne hard‑case mining).                                                                                                                      
  - Retraining cadence & 90‑day decay handling.                                                                                                                                         
  - Monitoring & debugging.                                                                                                                                                             
  - Security & wallet protection.

  Mark each item with the section title so you can literally **tick through the entire system end‑to‑end**.

  If you want, the next step can be: paste the latest `REALISTIC_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md` and this answer side‑by‑side, and a consolidated version can be produced that already includes     
  these new sections so you have **one single “final” document.**

  [12](https://iccv.thecvf.com/Conferences/2025/Videos) You don’t need a totally new plan; you need to **merge everything** into one “master index” and then plug the ICCV25 /          
  OpenDriveLab pieces into it.

Core goals and constraints                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  You already covered:                                                                                                                                                                  
  - Target: **StreetVision Subnet 72** – roadwork detection now, later more infrastructure tasks.[1][2]                                                                                 
  - Constraints: 90‑day model decay, need high accuracy on mixed real + synthetic, cost ceiling per month.[file:66dd31e1-ac1a-419b-baf5-03e0faf30e5c]                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Make sure your plan explicitly states:                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - **Primary goal:** top‑5 miner within 2–3 months, with stable uptime and auto‑retraining.                                                                                            
  - **Secondary goal:** architecture/general pipeline re‑usable for future driving / VLA / spatial AI tasks (alignment with OpenDriveLab & ICCV25).

  You have: candidate GPUs and cost envelopes, basic mining requirements (low latency, no timeouts).[file:66dd31e1-ac1a-419b-baf5-03e0faf30e5c]                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Ensure the plan includes:                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - **Concrete GPU choice** for v1: e.g. single RTX 3090 / 4090 (24 GB) or A100 40 GB with target latency < 100 ms per image.                                                           
  - **Hosting decision:** which provider (RunPod / Vast / Lambda) and how you’ll ensure 24/7 uptime.                                                                                    
  - **Docker + system layout:** one container for model inference + miner client; logs shipped to a small monitoring service.

  Also insert the **“VLA‑0 principle”** here:

ICCV25 “Learning to See” & OpenDriveLab alignment                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  This is the part you now want to integrate on top of all of the above.                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Add a dedicated section near the end, for example “Alignment with ICCV25 Learning‑to‑See & OpenDriveLab”:                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ### 7.1 World‑model / closed‑loop ideas (Kun Zhan)                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Capture the idea of **moving from data closed loop to training closed loop**:                                                                                                       
  - You train policies inside a high‑fidelity world model / simulator, with RL‑style rewards, until goals are satisfied.[8][9][10]                                                      
  - Note three pillars of their world model:                                                                                                                                            
  - Large‑scale 3DGS reconstruction (real scenes).                                                                                                                                      
  - Generative modules (DrivingSphere, Omni, RLGF) for rare/long‑tail scenarios.                                                                                                        
  - Simulation + RL engine with smart multi‑agent traffic, reward models (RHF, RxVR, RLF).[9][10][11]                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Then write how your plan **connects**:                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Today: you use SDXL / Cosmos + FiftyOne as a “poor man’s world model” for single‑image tasks.                                                                                       
  - Future: you plan to integrate with AV‑style simulators and world models (OpenDriveLab challenges, NVIDIA AV world models) to generate **trajectory‑consistent** data and            
  possibly train RL‑style policies.                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ### 7.2 VLA simplicity (Ankit Goyal)                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Summarize VLA‑0: actions as text tokens on top of an off‑the‑shelf VLM; no custom action head.[12][7]                                                                               
  - Connect to your plan:                                                                                                                                                               
  - Your decision layer (roadwork / no roadwork now; more complex actions later) sits **on top of a generic vision / vision‑language backbone**, matching this philosophy.              
  - If later StreetVision adds more complex driving‑action tasks, you will follow this design instead of inventing a heavy bespoke controller.

  Add 2–3 sentences that:                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Acknowledge that OpenDriveLab’s workshop focuses on **embodied spatial understanding, VLAs, simulation from real‑world data**.[12][8]                                               
  - State that your pipeline (synthetic data, DINOv3 backbones, active learning, alignment with world models) is designed so you can **reuse everything** when StreetVision moves       
  beyond roadwork into richer scene understanding / actions.                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ***                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## 8. What is still missing                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  After you add the above sections, the only things that may still be light are:                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - A **top‑level one‑page checklist** (so you can see if every aspect is implemented).                                                                                                 
  - A very short “Risks & Failure modes” list (timeouts, under‑training, bad synthetic quality, overfitting to validator distribution) and how you mitigate each.                       
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  You can base this on your own failure‑mode lists from `LastPlan.md` and `COMPLETE_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md`, compressed into 5–7

  If you want, the next step can be: copy‑paste the latest `REALISTIC_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md` content here and a merged, single “COMPLETEST MASTER PLAN” document can be produced that      
  already includes all these additions in the right places.

  [24](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3N9otbGBVLdiX50gDxYzxNvjRXsPw6cB) You should keep your core StreetVision plan, but add three concrete upgrades informed by Yann          
  LeCun, SAM 3, Molmo 2, vLLM video, and Modular’s small‑GPU story.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  1. Backbone choice (Yann LeCun + JEPA ideas)                                                                                                                                          
  LeCun’s core points that matter for you: world models should predict in abstract representation space, not pixels, and LLMs alone are bad at continuous noisy data like               
  video.youtube​[allenai](https://allenai.org/blog/molmo2)​                                                                                                                             
  Your current choice of DINO‑style image backbone + separate video/VLM model already follows this principle: you learn dense visual features first, then reason on top with a          
  smaller language head.youtube+1​                                                                                                                                                      
  Best action:                                                                                                                                                                          
  Keep DINOv3 (or similar strong vision encoder) as the main 2D backbone; do not replace it with a pure LLM‑only stack.youtube+1​                                                       
  When you add video, use Molmo 2 as a video world‑model head (tracking, counting, temporal reasoning) on top of visual features, not raw pixels or pure

  2. SAM 3 for data + exhaustivity (no RL)                                                                                                                                              
  From the SAM 3 talk and Roboflow docs: SAM 3 adds concept prompts, presence tokens, and a data engine that already produced 100M+ smart polygons and ~130 years of label time         
  saved.[roboflow](https://blog.roboflow.com/what-is-sam3/)​youtube​                                                                                                                    
  It segments images and videos with text prompts like “orange traffic cone” or “excavator” and can be fine‑tuned or used just to label data for a smaller RF‑DETR/YOLO‑type

  Best way for you to use SAM 3 (no RL):                                                                                                                                                
  Month 2+: use SAM 3 only for hard‑case annotation and coverage checks, not online inference.[roboflow](https://blog.roboflow.com/what-is-sam3/)​youtube​                              
  For each validator hard case:                                                                                                                                                         
  Run SAM 3 with prompts: “roadwork sign”, “orange cone”, “construction barrier”, “worker in vest”, “construction

  Let the SAM 3 + Roboflow verifier pipeline filter masks; you just correct the few misses.[roboflow](https://blog.roboflow.com/what-is-sam3/)​

  Train / refine your RF‑DETR or YOLO detector.[roboflow](https://blog.roboflow.com/what-is-sam3/)​                                                                                     
  Compute “did we find all objects?” checks to catch under‑detections in your cascade.youtube​

  No need for constant human annotation (cost reduction)                                                                                                                                
  Best‑case action:

  Add those three sections + the tool policies I outlined earlier, and your plan is genuinely best‑case for December 20, 2025.To push toward 99% accuracy and a genuinely “pro”         
  2025 setup, you need to upgrade three fronts at once: model, data, and evaluation/closed‑loop. Here is the minimal, concrete path.                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  1. Model stack for 99%                                                                                                                                                                
  Use DINOv3‑Base or Large as your primary backbone; it is the strongest open vision model as of late 2025 and explicitly designed for mixed real/synthetic

  Start with frozen backbone + 2–4 layer MLP head for binary roadwork; only go to full fine‑tuning if you hit a ceiling.                                                                
  Add one ensemble partner:                                                                                                                                                             
  Either ConvNeXt‑V2 (fast CNN) or SigLIP2 (better on weird synthetic / text‑like scenes).[lightly+1](https://www.lightly.ai/blog/dinov3)​                                              
  Use uncertainty‑aware fusion:                                                                                                                                                         
  For confident DINOv3 predictions, trust DINOv3.                                                                                                                                       
  For borderline cases (0.3–0.7), combine both models (average logits or a small learned fusion head).

  2. Data & synthetic at “world‑model level”                                                                                                                                            
  To get anywhere near 99%, model choice is less important than data and coverage:                                                                                                      
  Treat your synthetic setup as a mini world model:

  Always condition prompts on hard cases mined from validators (via FiftyOne), not random imagination.                                                                                  
  Maintain balanced distributions:                                                                                                                                                      
  Match real vs synthetic roughly 50/50 during training.                                                                                                                                
  Over‑sample rare conditions (night, heavy rain, dense traffic) until their validation error matches daytime error.                                                                    
  Continuously curate:                                                                                                                                                                  
  Routinely delete low‑quality, unrealistic, or mislabeled synthetic samples; bad synthetic hurts more than no synthetic.                                                               
  Think like Kun Zhan’s world model, but in 2D: the goal is coverage of all nasty edge cases, not just more images.youtube+1​

  Accuracy climbs when your model sees exactly the things it is bad at:

  For each cluster:                                                                                                                                                                     
  Generate 10–50 synthetic variants (different weather, light, offsets).                                                                                                                
  Retrain the head or a small adapter for 1–3 epochs.

  Evaluate on a fixed “challenge set” of your worst historical failures; if the score doesn’t improve, do not deploy.                                                                   
  This is your training closed loop: you are not just collecting more data; you are pushing the model until it solves concrete failure modes.youtube+1​

  To reach and maintain very high accuracy, you need a strict routine:

  Freeze decay by training a fresh head or lightly fine‑tuned backbone on the full curated dataset (real + synthetic + hardest cases).

  This index summarizes every core concept, tool, and strategy covered in this chat session to ensure nothing is missed in your final plan.                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ### 1. The Core Objective (StreetVision Subnet 72)                                                                                                                                    
  - **Goal:** Become a top-5 miner (99% accuracy) on Subnet 72 (Roadwork Detection).                                                                                                    
  - **Task:** Binary classification (Roadwork vs. No-Roadwork) on street images.                                                                                                        
  - **Constraints:**                                                                                                                                                                    
  - **90-day model decay:** Models lose reward weight after 90 days; must retrain/upload new.                                                                                           
  - **Latency:** < 100ms inference required.                                                                                                                                            
  - **Validator Data:** Mix of real (NATIX dataset) and ~50% synthetic (adversarial/edge-case) images.                                                                                  
  - **Cost:** Efficient GPU usage (e.g., RTX 3090/4090 or A100).                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ### 2. The Winning Model Stack (v1 & Future)                                                                                                                                          
  - **Primary Backbone (v1):** **DINOv3-Base** (frozen or lightly fine-tuned).                                                                                                          
  - *Why:* Best OOD robustness, Gram anchoring for synthetic stability.                                                                                                                 
  - *Head:* Simple 2-4 layer MLP classifier.                                                                                                                                            
  - **Ensemble Partner (Optional):** **ConvNeXt-V2** or **SigLIP2**.                                                                                                                    
  - *Role:* Complementary robustness; handles text-heavy synthetic scenes better.                                                                                                       
  - *Fusion:* Uncertainty-aware weighted average (trust DINOv3 on confident, average on borderline 0.3-0.7).                                                                            
  - **"VLA-0 Principle" (Ankit Goyal):**                                                                                                                                                
  - Keep action/decision layers simple (text tokens/labels) on top of strong vision backbones. Avoid bespoke control heads.                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ### 3. The Data Engine (World-Model Style)                                                                                                                                            
  - **Real Data:** NATIX dataset as foundation.                                                                                                                                         
  - **Synthetic Data (The "World Model"):**                                                                                                                                             
  - Use SDXL/Cosmos to generate targeted edge cases (night, rain, fog, weird cones).                                                                                                    
  - *Goal:* 50/50 mix of real vs. synthetic.                                                                                                                                            
  - *Future Alignment (Kun Zhan):* Move toward 3DGS reconstruction + generative simulation for trajectory-consistent data.                                                              
  - **Active Learning (The "Closed Loop"):**                                                                                                                                            
  - **Tool:** **FiftyOne**.                                                                                                                                                             
  - *Daily Loop:* Log predictions -> Mine hard cases (wrong/low-confidence) -> Cluster -> Generate synthetic variants -> Retrain.                                                       
  - *Outcome:* Model learns from its own failures daily.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ### 4. Training Strategy & Discipline                                                                                                                                                 
  - **Daily Loop:** Small updates on mined hard cases (1-3 epochs).                                                                                                                     
  - **Major Cycle (~60 Days):** Full retrain/refresh on curated dataset (Real + Synthetic + Hard Cases) to reset decay timer.                                                           
  - **Curriculum Learning:** Start easy (clean real images), gradually add hard/synthetic cases.                                                                                        
  - **Hard Negative Mining:** Explicitly target false positives/negatives.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ### 5. Infrastructure & Ops                                                                                                                                                           
  - **Hardware:** Single **RTX 3090 / 4090** (24GB VRAM) is sufficient for v1.                                                                                                          
  - **Deployment:** Docker container (Inference + Miner Client).

  > **Design Philosophy (VLA-0 Principle):** Following Ankit Goyal's ICCV25 insights, we keep the decision layer minimal. Actions (Roadwork/No-Roadwork) are treated as simple          
  label tokens on top of a strong, frozen vision backbone (DINOv3). We avoid complex, bespoke control heads to ensure modularity and scalability.

  ### 7.1 From Data Loop to Training Closed Loop (Kun Zhan)                                                                                                                             
  - **Current (v1):** We use FiftyOne + SDXL to manually close the data loop (mine failure -> gen synthetic -> retrain).                                                                
  - **Future (v2):** We will integrate with AV-style World Models (e.g., 3DGS reconstruction + Generative Simulators) to generate trajectory-consistent synthetic data. Training        
  will become goal-driven (e.g., "minimize safety violations") rather than just accuracy-driven.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ### 7.2 Generative World Model Integration                                                                                                                                            
  - We treat our synthetic data engine not just as an augmentor, but as a "Mini World Model" designed to simulate rare, long-tail scenarios (night, extreme weather, weird              
  occlusions) that real data misses. This ensures robust generalization beyond the training set.                                                                                        
  ```

  static accuracy.

  - **Principle:** We stick to "Actions as Tokens." Even for complex future tasks (e.g., "Drive Safely"), we will output simple text tokens on top of our strong visual backbone,       
  avoiding complex bespoke controllers.

  - **Tech:** Leverage **Glomap** for global mapping and **Gaussian Splatting** for dense reconstruction.                                                                               
  - **Application:** Use these 3D priors to generate better synthetic training data (Novel View Synthesis) for our DINOv3 model.

  ## What these OpenDriveLab videos give you                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - They define the **target future**: city‑scale 3D reconstruction, generative world models (3DGS + diffusion), and training closed loops for driving.[3][4]                           
  - They show how to use **Driving world models** (e.g., DriveAGI) as the backbone for simulation‑driven training, not just single‑image classifiers.[5]                                
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  For StreetVision now, that means:                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Stay with **DINOv3** + small head as your main miner (you already planned this).[6]                                                                                                 
  - Design your data/synthetic/active‑learning loop so it can later plug into **OpenDriveLab‑style world models** (3DGS, Glomap, DriveAGI) instead of SDXL only.[4][7]                  
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## What you should do next (concrete)                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  1. **Add one short “OpenDriveLab Alignment” section** to your plan:                                                                                                                   
  - Mention “Learning to See: Advancing Spatial Understanding for Embodied Intelligence” and list: world model, spatial AI, VLAs as the long‑term direction.[8][2]                      
  - State that your StreetVision miner is built so the backbone + data engine can be reused with DriveAGI / OpenDriveLab stacks later.[5]                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  2. **In your synthetic data section**, add 2–3 sentences:                                                                                                                             
  - Today: SDXL/Cosmos generating 2D edge cases.                                                                                                                                        
  - Future: replace/augment with **3DGS‑based scene generators** (like the 3D city work in EARTH‑3D / Skyfall‑GS) to get multi‑view, trajectory‑consistent samples.[7][9]               
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  3. **In your “future work” / “Phase 4”**, write:                                                                                                                                      
  - Integrate an **OpenDriveLab driving world model** (DriveAGI or successors) as the source of rare‑scenario data and as an evaluation environment for closed‑loop testing,            
  following Kun Zhan’s “from data closed‑loop to training closed‑loop” idea.[3][4][5]                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  If you paste your current REALISTIC_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN section around “future work” or “ICCV alignment,” a very tight, ready‑to‑paste “OpenDriveLab alignment” block can be written      
  directly into it.

  [22](https://www.worldlabs.ai/blog) To be “the best of both” Kun Zhan and OpenDriveLab for StreetVision, you should not copy their huge systems; you should **mount your small        
  miner on top of their ecosystem** and use their assets where they give you real edge.

  - Add **one** extra model for robustness:                                                                                                                                             
  - SigLIP2 or ConvNeXt‑V2 for weird synthetic / text‑heavy scenes.                                                                                                                     
  - Keep output as **tokens/labels**, matching Kun Zhan’s VLA roadmap and Doe‑1’s token‑based scene representation.[3][4]                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  You are then using the same style of strong vision encoder + tokenized actions that Kun Zhan’s team and Doe‑1 use (just much smaller).[5][3]                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ***                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## 2. Stand on OpenDriveLab’s shoulders instead of rebuilding them                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  OpenDriveLab has already done the heavy lifting:                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - **DriveAGI** repo: foundation driving models, OpenDV video dataset, OpenLane‑V2 maps.[6][7]                                                                                         
  - **Doe‑1 GitHub**: closed‑loop world model with observation/description/action tokens and unified driving tasks.[4][5]                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  What you can realistically do:                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  1. **Use their data and representations, not train their models from scratch.**                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Download **OpenDV‑mini** subset (tens of GB, not 24 TB) from DriveAGI and use it to:                                                                                                
  - Pretrain or validate your DINOv3 features on driving scenes.[6]                                                                                                                     
  - Build a small internal “challenge set” of roadwork‑like scenes (cones, lane closures) from OpenDV‑mini.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  2. **Borrow their scene structure ideas.**                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Study DriveAGI’s tasks (prediction, planning, lane topology) and Doe‑1’s observation / description / action token format.[5][6]                                                     
  - In your own data pipeline, log for each StreetVision sample:                                                                                                                        
  - Observation: raw image + DINOv3 embedding.                                                                                                                                          
  - Description: short text caption (e.g., “two cones and one excavator in right lane”).                                                                                                
  - Action: binary label (roadwork yes/no).                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  That keeps your miner’s logs formatted like a **mini Doe‑1 dataset**, which is powerful for future upgrades.[4][5]                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ***                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## 3. Turn your active‑learning loop into a small closed‑loop trainer                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  From Kun Zhan, Doe‑1, AD‑R1, WoW! and similar work, the pattern is: world model + closed‑loop RL or GRPO‑style policy updates.[8][9][10]                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  For StreetVision, the maximal but feasible version is:                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - **Teacher–student self‑learning (GRPO‑style but light):**                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Teacher: the last deployed DINOv3 model (EMA copy).                                                                                                                                 
  - Student: new model trained on hard cases + synthetic.                                                                                                                               
  - Training set each week:                                                                                                                                                             
  - Hard cases where teacher was wrong.

  - Filter out samples where the new model becomes over‑confident too fast (very low entropy), inspired by M‑GRPO / AD‑R1 ideas.[8]

  - For each mined failure mode cluster (e.g., night + cones + rain), generate many SDXL variants.                                                                                      
  - Optionally, sample **driving clips** from OpenDV‑mini or DriveAGI that look similar and use them to validate that your model is robust under motion.[11][6]                         
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  You are not training a full RL policy, but you are following the **same closed‑loop shape**: observe → simulate synthetic variants → update → check on challenge set.[9][10]

  - Implement a **teacher–student self‑learning step** with EMA + entropy filtering, inspired by GRPO/AD‑R1, for your weekly retrain.[10][8]                                            
  - Build a fixed “challenge set” of your nastiest failures and require improvements on it for every new model version.[2]

  - Download **OpenDV‑mini** from DriveAGI, and run small experiments:                                                                                                                  
  - Train or fine‑tune your DINOv3 head on a mixture of NATIX + OpenDV‑mini roadwork‑like frames.[6]                                                                                    
  - Compare performance with NATIX‑only training.                                                                                                                                       
  - Export embeddings and labels in a Doe‑1‑style “observation/description/action” format so your dataset can later be used with closed‑loop world models.[4][5]                        
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  If you execute this, you will not just be a strong StreetVision miner; you will be the miner whose pipeline looks most like a **small, applied version of Kun Zhan + OpenDriveLab     
  world‑model research**, which is exactly what you want.

  **a) Core model stack**                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Make **DINOv3‑Base (or Large)** your primary backbone, with:                                                                                                                        
  - Frozen or lightly fine‑tuned encoder.                                                                                                                                               
  - 2–4 layer MLP head for roadwork / no‑roadwork.[1][2]                                                                                                                                
  - Add **one** extra model for robustness:                                                                                                                                             
  - SigLIP2 or ConvNeXt‑V2 for weird synthetic / text‑heavy scenes.                                                                                                                     
  - Keep output as **tokens/labels**, matching Kun Zhan’s VLA roadmap and Doe‑1’s token‑based scene representation.[3][4]                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  You are then using the same style of strong vision encoder + tokenized actions that Kun Zhan’s team and Doe‑1 use (just much smaller).[5][3]                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ***                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## 2. Stand on OpenDriveLab’s shoulders instead of rebuilding them                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  OpenDriveLab has already done the heavy lifting:                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - **DriveAGI** repo: foundation driving models, OpenDV video dataset, OpenLane‑V2 maps.[6][7]                                                                                         
  - **Doe‑1 GitHub**: closed‑loop world model with observation/description/action tokens and unified driving tasks.[4][5]                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  What you can realistically do:                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  1. **Use their data and representations, not train their models from scratch.**                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Download **OpenDV‑mini** subset (tens of GB, not 24 TB) from DriveAGI and use it to:                                                                                                
  - Pretrain or validate your DINOv3 features on driving scenes.[6]                                                                                                                     
  - Build a small internal “challenge set” of roadwork‑like scenes (cones, lane closures) from OpenDV‑mini.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  2. **Borrow their scene structure ideas.**                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Study DriveAGI’s tasks (prediction, planning, lane topology) and Doe‑1’s observation / description / action token format.[5][6]                                                     
  - In your own data pipeline, log for each StreetVision sample:                                                                                                                        
  - Observation: raw image + DINOv3 embedding.                                                                                                                                          
  - Description: short text caption (e.g., “two cones and one excavator in right lane”).                                                                                                
  - Action: binary label (roadwork yes/no).                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  That keeps your miner’s logs formatted like a **mini Doe‑1 dataset**, which is powerful for future upgrades.[4][5]                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ***                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## 3. Turn your active‑learning loop into a small closed‑loop trainer                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  From Kun Zhan, Doe‑1, AD‑R1, WoW! and similar work, the pattern is: world model + closed‑loop RL or GRPO‑style policy updates.[8][9][10]                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  For StreetVision, the maximal but feasible version is:                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - **Teacher–student self‑learning (GRPO‑style but light):**                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Teacher: the last deployed DINOv3 model (EMA copy).

  - Implement a **teacher–student self‑learning step** with EMA + entropy filtering, inspired by GRPO/AD‑R1, for your weekly retrain.[10][8]                                            
  - Build a fixed “challenge set” of your nastiest failures and require improvements on it for every new model version.[2]

  - Download **OpenDV‑mini** from DriveAGI, and run small experiments:                                                                                                                  
  - Train or fine‑tune your DINOv3 head on a mixture of NATIX + OpenDV‑mini roadwork‑like frames.[6]                                                                                    
  - Compare performance with NATIX‑only training.                                                                                                                                       
  - Export embeddings and labels in a Doe‑1‑style “observation/description/action” format so your dataset can later be used with closed‑loop world models.[4][5]                        
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  If you execute this, you will not just be a strong StreetVision miner; you will be the miner whose pipeline looks most like a **small, applied version of Kun Zhan + OpenDriveLab     
  world‑model research**, which is exactly what you want.

  [28](https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/DriveAGI/labels?sort=count-desc) Yes, it is okay, and in fact a very strong move, to use OpenDriveLab’s own AGI models from **DriveAGI** as      
  long as you respect their license and have enough compute.

Legality and “is it allowed?”                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - **DriveAGI is open source** under the license in its repo. You are allowed to:                                                                                                      
  - Clone the code,                                                                                                                                                                     
  - Run their pretrained models,                                                                                                                                                        
  - Fine‑tune on your own data,                                                                                                                                                         
  - Integrate features into your StreetVision miner,                                                                                                                                    
  as long as you follow the license terms (usually attribution and non‑misuse).[1][2]                                                                                                   
  - From a StreetVision / NATIX side there is no restriction against using external open‑source models; they only care about accuracy, latency, and uptime.[3][4]                       
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  So yes: **you can legally run DriveAGI models and use them in your miner**.                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ***                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## 2. Should you replace your StreetVision model with DriveAGI?                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  For Subnet 72 (single‑image roadwork classification), the best practical approach is:                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Keep **DINOv3‑Base + MLP** as the main StreetVision head (fast, simple, easy to fine‑tune on NATIX).[5][6]                                                                          
  - Use **DriveAGI models as powerful feature extractors or teachers**, not as the primary live classifier.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Reasons:                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - DriveAGI models are heavier, designed for multi‑task driving (perception/prediction/planning), and may be overkill / too slow to run on every StreetVision image.[7][1]             
  - You control DINOv3 fine‑tuning and quantization much more easily for latency and 24/7 reliability.                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ***                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ## 3. Best “pro” way to use DriveAGI with StreetVision                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  A strong setup that *does* use their AGI models:                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  1. **Offline teacher / feature extractor**                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Run one of DriveAGI’s pretrained perception heads (e.g., BEV or scene encoder) on:                                                                                                  
  - A subset of NATIX images,                                                                                                                                                           
  - Your hardest StreetVision failures,                                                                                                                                                 
  - Some OpenDV samples.[1]                                                                                                                                                             
  - Extract high‑level features or pseudo‑labels (e.g., lane topology, free space, object heatmaps).                                                                                    
  - Train your **DINOv3 head** to match or use these signals (distillation), so your StreetVision model inherits some “driving awareness” from DriveAGI without running it live.        
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  2. **Evaluation / challenge set**                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - Use DriveAGI data and models to build a **“pro challenge set”**:                                                                                                                    
  - Scenes with complex traffic + roadwork‑like patterns.                                                                                                                               
  - Always evaluate new StreetVision models on this set to check real‑world robustness.[7][1]                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  3. **Optional: low‑rate live cascade**                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - For a small fraction of StreetVision queries (e.g., 1–5% of ambiguous ones), you *can* send the image (or a short frame sequence) through a lighter DriveAGI perception             
  model and combine its output with your DINOv3 classifier.                                                                                                                             
  - This gives you “DriveAGI‑level” reasoning on the hardest cases without blowing up latency and cost.

  ## 4. When *not* to use DriveAGI directly                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Avoid making DriveAGI your primary live miner model if:                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - It does not meet StreetVision latency (<100 ms) on your 3090/4090.                                                                                                                  
  - It requires too much VRAM / multi‑GPU to run reliably 24/7.                                                                                                                         
  - Fine‑tuning it for your very specific binary task is harder than keeping it as a teacher.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  In that situation, your miner is best as:                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  - **Production:** DINOv3 + small head (and maybe SigLIP2/YOLO helper).                                                                                                                
  - **Research/teacher:** DriveAGI + Doe‑1 world‑model code used offline to improve your training data, features, and evaluation.[8][1]                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  ***                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  So: using **DriveAGI** is not only “ok”, it is one of the strongest ways to be more “pro” and closer to Kun Zhan / OpenDriveLab—just keep it as a **teacher and backbone for          
  research**, while your StreetVision miner remains a lean, DINOv3‑based production model tuned for speed and uptime.

  discussions (Modular, SGLang, vLLM, SAM 3, Molmo 2, DriveAGI, Kun Zhan / OpenDriveLab, etc.). Below is that checklist, grouped by where it goes in your plans.

  - Limit to the hardest 5–10% of video queries to stay within latency and GPU budget.[9][10]

  - Describe **Marengo 3.0** as a **long‑video embedding & retrieval engine**, not your main classifier.[11][12]                                                                        
  - In your pipeline:                                                                                                                                                                   
  - Break long videos into ~6‑second segments and embed them with Marengo (1024‑D multimodal vectors).[13][14]                                                                          
  - Use semantic search (“night roadwork with flashing lights”, “new cones placed”) to find candidate segments, then send only those clips to Molmo‑2 / DINOv3.[14][15]

  - Make **FiftyOne + FiftyOne Brain** the center of your active‑learning loop.[16][3]

  - Use embeddings + “hardness” scores to mine the hardest StreetVision samples (wrong or high‑uncertainty) each day.[3]                                                                
  - Visualize clusters of failure modes and pick batches for SDXL/SAM‑3 annotation and retraining.                                                                                      
  - Optionally mention the **Active Learning plugin** for automating uncertainty‑based querying.[17][18]

  If you drop one short “Omni + Molmo‑2 + Marengo + FiftyOne stack” subsection with these bullets into your ULTIMATE plan, you will fully capture what those YouTube talks are          
  doing, but tailored to StreetVision.
