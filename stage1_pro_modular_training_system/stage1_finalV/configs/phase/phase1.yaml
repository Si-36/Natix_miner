# Phase 1 Configuration - Baseline Training (Frozen Backbone)
# ============================================================================
# Implements TODO 129: Phase 1 config with frozen backbone, model selection
# ============================================================================

# Inherit from base and override phase-specific settings
defaults:
  - base
  
# Override training mode for Phase 1
training:
  mode: frozen                   # frozen backbone, train head only (fastest iteration)
  
# Override checkpointing for Phase 1
lightning:
  checkpointing:
    filename: "phase1/epoch{epoch:02d}-val_select{acc:.4f}.pth"

# Override data splits for Phase 1
data:
  splits:
    train: train                # Use TRAIN split
    val_select: val_select        # Use VAL_SELECT for model selection ONLY
    val_calib: val_calib        # Use VAL_CALIB for later calibration
    val_test: val_test            # Use VAL_TEST for final eval ONLY
