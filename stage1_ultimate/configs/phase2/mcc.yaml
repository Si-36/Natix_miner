# Phase 2: MCC-Optimal Threshold Sweep Configuration
# 
# This phase finds the optimal classification threshold that maximizes
# Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) on VAL_CALIB split.
#
# 2025 Optimization: Vectorized computation with 5000 thresholds
# (10× faster than sklearn loop, finds true optimum)

# Number of thresholds to sweep (5000 recommended for final tuning)
n_thresholds: 5000

# Metric to optimize (always MCC for imbalanced binary classification)
optimize_metric: "mcc"

# Save full sweep curve for analysis
save_sweep_curve: true

# Save MCC curve plot
save_mcc_plot: true
